X-OpenPanels-HW

This is the hardware part for X-OpenPanels, a toolset to create your own
panels for X-Plane. It is aimed to give an easy to user hardware framework
for the PIC18, PIC24, or PIC32 USB Microcontrollers to create joystick like
hardwares and aviation game panels.

This is a very alpha stage project, you'll find the code as-is without much
documentation.

Current version is configured and tested with a PIC18 microcontroller, and
has the following features:

 - 4 independent joystick axes
 - supports 64 physical button inputs (via matrix connection)
 - inputs can be configured in pairs for rotary switches
 - support for edge triggered virtual buttons (128 software buttons at all,
   and you can save money on the switches)
 - buttons may be set as "delayed-off": off signal is delayed
 - easily reconfigurable button setup (if you know C)
 - supports 16 independent leds writable by the client software

Software is based on the Michrochip Demo Joystick code. This version is in very alpha stage,
and without much documentation, but you'll free to use it, modify it for
your will.

Good luck, and if you have questions contact me at
